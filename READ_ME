2. System Components
    2.a Hardware
        Optical Components: Lenses, mirrors, and filters for directing and conditioning light.

        Light Source: Uniform illumination for consistent imaging.

        Spectrometer: Captures spectral information from the sample.

        Camera: Records spatial and spectral data.

        Motorized Stage (optional): Enables automated scanning of samples.

    2.b Electronics
        Microcontroller or PC Interface: Controls hardware and communicates with the software.

        Power Supply: Provides stable power to all components.

3. Assembly Instructions
    3.a Mechanical Assembly

        Mount the optical components on the base platform, ensuring precise alignment.

        Secure the light source to provide even illumination across the sample area.

        Install the spectrometer and camera, aligning them with the optical path.

        If using a motorized stage, assemble and test its movement.

    3.b Wiring & Connections

        Connect the camera, spectrometer, and motorized stage (if present) to the microcontroller or PC.

        Ensure all power connections are secure and compliant with voltage requirements.

4. Electronics & Control
    Set up the microcontroller or connect the system directly to a PC via USB or other interfaces.

    Load or install the necessary drivers for camera and spectrometer operation.

    Test basic connectivity and functionality before proceeding to full system integration.

5. Software Overview
    5.a Data Acquisition

        The software controls image capture, hardware synchronization, and data storage.

        User interface allows for manual or automated image acquisition.

    5.b Image Processing Pipeline

        Preprocessing: Straightens slanted images and corrects for rotation.

        Edge Detection: Uses Canny algorithm to identify features and lines in calibration images.

        Line Detection: Python scripts with OpenCV detect vertical lines; duplicates and weak edges are filtered out.

        Spatial Calibration: Calculates pixel distances between lines and converts to real-world units.

    5.c User Interface

        Provides controls for starting scans, adjusting parameters, and saving images.

        Messaging features confirm successful image saving and other actions.

6. Calibration Procedures

    6.a Spatial Calibration

        Capture calibration images using the hyperspectral sensor.

        Apply edge and line detection to identify reference features.

        Calculate pixel-to-distance conversion using known calibration targets.

    6.b Rotation Correction

        Use code snippets to correct image rotation and ensure consistent alignment.

        Verify that vertical lines are accurately detected after correction.

    6.c Spectral & Radiometric Calibration

        Capture dark current, white reference, and sample images under identical conditions.

        Apply calibration formulas to convert raw data to reflectance or radiance.

7. Data Acquisition & Processing
    Acquire hyperspectral images of samples using the user interface.

    Preprocess images for alignment and quality.

    Visualize data using 2D and 3D plots of pixel intensity and spatial distribution.

    Analyze results for scientific or industrial insights.

8. Testing & Validation
    Perform initial system calibration and alignment.

    Run test scans to check image quality and spectral accuracy.

    Validate results using known standards or reference samples.

    Document calibration constants and procedures for reproducibility.

9. Documentation & Reporting
    Maintain a build log with assembly steps and any modifications.

    Write a user manual for system operation and data analysis.

    Record all calibration data, test results, and troubleshooting steps.

10. Troubleshooting & Tips
    Use calibration targets (white reference, spectral standards) for accuracy.

    Regularly back up software, data, and documentation.

    Have another user test the system and manual for clarity.

    Optimize edge detection and line detection parameters for your specific setup.

    For code issues in spatial calibration (e.g., for NIR filters), review Python/OpenCV scripts and confirm calibration targets are well-defined.
